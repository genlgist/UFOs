# Overview
The goal of this project is to be able to perform searches on UFO sightings using multiple criteria simultaneously.

# Deliverable 1 

I modified the code in the index.html file to add more table filters:  city, state, country, and shape.

# Results

I added the additional filters of city, state, country and shape.  I was able to successfully search on each filter and combined filters.

Search 1 was performed using the date of 1/11/2010, the state of fl and the shape of fireball.  See images/search_1.png.

Search 2 was performed using the state of or and the shape of changing.  See images/search_2.png.

# Recommendations

Search results should be retained even when the page is refreshed.
Default values should be able to be removed from the search field.  It's confusing to see them when searching on different criteria.
Add the filter table button back to the page.
Add functionality to print out search results.
Return a message if search criteria does not produce results.
